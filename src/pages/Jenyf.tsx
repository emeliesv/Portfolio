      <h3 className="font-display text-4xl">Project description</h3>
      <p>
        This project is a web shop built with React (Vite), where we focused on
        responsive design, API calls, semantic code and a scalable code
        structure. We fetched products from a dummy API using async/await and
        managed the shopping cart state using React Context. The purpose of the
        project was to learn agile methodology, teambased version control and to
        creat a userf-friendly e-commerce application. We worked on the project
        for three weeks, including design in Figma, development and testing.

      <h3 className="font-display text-4xl">Technologies used</h3>
      <ul className="px-3 list-disc text-xl">
        <li>React (Vite) for a fast and modern frontend development</li>
        <li>React router for navigation</li>
        <li>React Context API for global state management</li>
        <li>Tailwind CSS for styling and responsive design</li>
        <li>Git & GitHub for version control and collaboration</li>
        <li>Netlify for deployment</li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="font-display text-3xl">Git & GitHub</h4>
      <p>
        We used a protected main branch and a development branch. Each developer
        created feature branches named according to their assigned ticket and
        pushed them to the dev branch before merging them via a pull request.
        This workflow minimized merge conflicts and kept the codebase clean. To
        organize tasks and milestones we used GitHub projects, where we were
        able to clearly trace issues and commits to specific tickets. Pull
        requests and code reviews were conducted regurarly within the team. This
        workflow provided a realistic team experience, making us better prepared
        for professional development work.

      <h4 className="font-display text-3xl">Workflows and team roles</h4>
      <p>
        We worked agile with regular daily stand-ups and used the Kanban board
        in Github Projects to plan and track our tasks. My role in this was Lead
        developer and included responsibilities such as:
      </p>
      <ul className="px-3 list-disc text-xl">
        <li>Ensure code quality and adherence to best practices</li>
        <li>Code review and support resolving merge conflicts</li>
        <li>Support team members with technical challanges</li>
        <li>
          Ensure semantically correct code and that the website was accessible
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h3 className="font-display text-4xl">Challenges and takeaways</h3>
      <p>
        We encountered several technical challenges but learned a lot through
        collaboration and problem-solving. One of the most challenging aspects
        was implementing the breadcrumbs navigation, as we initially struggled
        with properly updating the state and routes. We also gained a deeper
        understanding of React Context combined with React Query, which proivded
        insights into efficiently managing global data.
      </p>

      <h4 className="font-display text-3xl">Successes</h4>
      <ul className="list-disc px-3 text-xl">
        <li>
          We maintained a strong teamwork and communication through pair and mob
          programming
        </li>
        <li>
          Our approach to feature branches and pull requests ensured a
          well-structured codebase with few conflicts
        </li>
        <li>
          Our problem-solving process was effective, as we actively engaged in
          discussions and shared knowledge within the team
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="font-display text-3xl">Areas for improvement</h4>
      <ul className="px-3 list-disc text-xl">
        <li>
          More even distribution of tasks in the early stages of the project
        </li>
        <li>
          Implementing testing earlier on in the process to detect and fix bugs
          more efficiently
        </li>
      </ul>

      <h4 className="font-display text-3xl">Final thoughts</h4>
      <p>
        The project provided us with a realistic experience of working in a
        development team. We gained experience in agile methodology, code review
        and collaboration using GitHub, which makes us better prepared for
        professional work. We learned the importance of communication,
        understanding and explaining code and working iteratively to solve
        problems together. All and all, this project was a great success for me
        personally as we grew as a team and I got to grow even more as a
        developer!
